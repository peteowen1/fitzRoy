\title{Return the fixture for a particular round of matches}
\usage{
fetch_fixture(
  season = NULL,
  round_number = NULL,
  comp = "AFLM",
  source = "AFL",
  ...
)

fetch_fixture_afl(season = NULL, round_number = NULL, comp = "AFLM")

fetch_fixture_footywire(
  season = NULL,
  round_number = NULL,
  convert_date = FALSE
)

fetch_fixture_squiggle(season = NULL, round_number = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{season}{Season in YYYY format, defaults to NULL which returns the year
corresponding the \code{Sys.Date()}}

\item{round_number}{Round number, defaults to NULL which returns latest round}

\item{comp}{One of "AFLM" (default), "AFLW", "VFL", "VFLW", "WAFL", "U18B" or "U18G." Not all data sources will have non-AFL data}

\item{source}{One of "AFL" (default), "footywire", "fryzigg", "afltables", "squiggle"}

\item{...}{Optional parameters passed onto various functions depending on source.}

\item{convert_date}{logical, if TRUE, converts date column to date format instead of date time.}
}
\value{
A Tibble with the fixture from the relevant \code{season} and \code{round}.
}
\description{
\code{fetch_fixture} returns the Fixture for a given AFL Round. Internally, it calls
a corresponding \verb{fetch_fixture_*} function that depends on the source given.
By default the source used will be the official AFL website.

\code{\link[=fetch_fixture_afl]{fetch_fixture_afl()}}, \code{\link[=fetch_fixture_footywire]{fetch_fixture_footywire()}}, \code{\link[=fetch_fixture_squiggle]{fetch_fixture_squiggle()}}
can be called directly and return data from AFL website, AFL Tables and
Squiggle, respectively.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Return data for whole season from AFL Website
fetch_fixture(2020)

# This is equivalent to
fetch_fixture(2020, source = "AFL")
fetch_fixture_afl(2020)

# Return AFLW data
fetch_fixture(2020, comp = "AFLW", source = "AFL")
fetch_fixture_afl(2020, comp = "AFLW")

# Not all sources have AFLW data and will return a warning
fetch_fixture(2020, comp = "AFLW", source = "footywire")
fetch_fixture(2020, comp = "AFLW", source = "squiggle")

# Different sources
fetch_fixture(2015, round_number = 5, source = "footywire")
fetch_fixture(2015, round_number = 5, source = "squiggle")

# Directly call functions for each source
fetch_fixture_afl(2018, round_number = 9)
fetch_fixture_footywire(2018, round_number = 9)
fetch_fixture_squiggle(2018, round_number = 9)
}
